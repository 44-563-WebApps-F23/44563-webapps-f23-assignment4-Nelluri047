            MRS LINDE.
            Yes, why not?
        </p>
        <p>
            KROGSTAD.
            Certainly—why not?
        </p>
        <p>

            MRS LINDE.
            Now, Nils, let us have a talk.
        </p>
        <p>
            KROGSTAD.
            Can we two have anything to talk about?
        </p>
        <p>
            MRS LINDE.
            We have a great deal to talk about.
        </p>
        <p>
            KROGSTAD.
            I shouldn’t have thought so.
        </p>
        <p>
            MRS LINDE.
            No, you have never properly understood me.
        </p>
        <p>
            KROGSTAD.
            Was there anything else to understand except what was obvious to all
            the world—a heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrative chance
            turns up?
